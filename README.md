# Nudge
Context: In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is essential, calling for strategies that help users make safer decisions without overburdening cognitive resources.
Problem: Complex security settings often confuse users, leading to risky behaviors and diminished privacy. Traditional approaches overlook cognitive biases and user attention limitations.
Proposed Solution: This study employs "nudges" — subtle behavioral intervention — to encourage secure actions in software privacy and security, leveraging principles from behavioral economics to facilitate safer decision-making.
Information Systems Theory: The research draws on Thaler and Sunstein’s nudging framework, examining how choice architecture can shape user behavior in digital security without imposing constraints.
Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, utilizing a structured protocol to identify, analyze, and synthesize studies assessing digital nudges in cybersecurity. Key search terms and selection criteria ensured thorough coverage.
Summary of Results: The review finds that nudges such as reminders, defaults, and social norms are effective in promoting security-conscious behaviors. Visual and contextual nudges significantly enhance user awareness and adaptation of secure settings.
Contributions: This work synthesizes evidence on nudges' roles in strengthening software security, offering insights for designing interfaces that reduce cognitive load and encourage privacy-conscious choices.
Impact on Information Systems: By showing nudges' effectiveness, this study suggests new paths for user-centered security measures, promoting a shift in how information systems address decision-making in cybersecurity.
